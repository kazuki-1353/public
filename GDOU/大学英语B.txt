Passage 1
My husband got married in 1981 and for the first ten years of our marriage I was happy to stay home and raise our three children. The four years ago, my youngest child went to school and I thought I might go back to work.
My husband was very supportive and helped me to make my decision. He emphasized all of the things I could do around the house, and said he thought I could be a great success in business.
After several weeks of looking for a job, I found my present job, which was working for a small public relations firm. At first, my husband was very proud of me and would tell his friends, "My clever little wife can run that company she's working for.”
But as his joking statement approached truth, my husband stopped talking to me about my job. I have received several promotions and pay increases, and I'm now making more money than he is. I can buy my new clothes and a new car. Because of our joint incomes, my husband and I can do many things we had always dreamed of doing, but we don't do these things because he is very unhappy.
We fight about little things and my husband is very critical of me in front of our friends. For the first time in our marriage, I think it is possible that our marriage may come to an end.
I love my husband very much, and I don't want him to feel inferior, but I also love my job. I think I can be a good wife and a working woman, but I don't know how. Who can give me some advice? Will I have to choose one or the other or can I keep both my husband and my new career?
1. The passage was probably written around 1996.

Passage 2
A group of frogs wre traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into  a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed of （倾听）what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.
The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs shouted at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frog said, "Didn't you hear us?” The frog explained to them that he was a little deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.
The story teaches us two lessons:
1. There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift him up and help him make it through the day.
2. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill him.
Be careful of what you say. The power of words is sometimes hard to understand because an encouraging word can go such a long way. Anyone can speak words that tend to rob another of the spirit to continue in difficult times. Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another.
1.The underlined expression "as good as”(in Line 2, Para. 1) means    
A. Hardly
B. equally good
C. no better than
D. almost, practically 
正确答案是：D

A. were so afraid of the danger
B. make up their mind to stay in the pit quietly
C. paid no attention to what they said and tried their best to get out
D. gave up their efforts immediately
正确答案是：C

3.One of the frogs fell down and died because    
A. he noticed what the other frogs were saying and stopped struggling
B. he was so tired
C. he didn't trust himself
D. he saw the other frogs unwilling to help him
正确答案是：A

4.The other frog managed to jump out of the pit because   
A. he was very strong physically
  B. his ears were not good and he mistook their words for encouragement
  C. he didn't believe what the other frogs had said
  D. the pit was not deep enough
 正确答案是：B

5. Which of the following is TRUE?
A. An encouraging word may discourage others when they are in difficult times.
B. People should avoid saying destructive words to those who are in trouble. 
C. The power of words lies in the beauty of language.
D. Words are just words and we don't have to be careful with words.

Passage 1
 
    Withdrawing money from the bank used to be so convenient. You could visit a money machine almost anywhere. Without paying a cent, you could get enough cash to buy a television or put a large down payment on some basketball shoes.
    But a couple of years ago some banks started charging a fee. If you didn’t have an account with them, you had to pay at least a dollar to withdraw money at their ATM (Automatic Teller Machine).
    Other banks followed suit and now the majority charge a fee. Some even charge as much as $3! For many people who withdraw money from ATMs daily, that’s more than many would actually save in a year.
    That’s a steep fee, especially when you’re trying to withdraw $5.
    To their credit, banks have tried to make ATMs much safer for us. They’ve installed bright lights and security cameras. They don’t want anyone else robbing us.
    Some lawmakers, bless their hearts, are trying to put a limit on the surcharges. They don’t want bankers to get carried away and use ATMs to pay for their BMWs. They don’t want the ATMs to display this message: “Please withdraw only half as much as you can afford, because we’re taking the other half.”
    Banks say they have to charge a fee because ATMs are expensive. They cost as much as $80,000 and that doesn’t even include the money inside.
    It would be cheaper to put a human in a box. But there’s probably a law against that. And humans, unlike machines, are prone to making mistakes. They’re also prone to running off to Mexico with the money.
    The surcharge also allows banks to install ATMs in many convenient places, such as parks, plazas and prisons. But in their haste to make ATMs more convenient, banks have made them less convenient for people like me. I’d rather have one free ATM in my neighborhood, than a dozen that want to swindle me. A couple of dollars may not seem like much to a banker, but to me, it means a feast at Taco Bell.
 
6. Using ATMs to withdraw money from the bank used to be free and convenient.
选择一项：
A. True 
B. False
正确答案是：True

Now all the banks will charge you $3 when you use their ATMs if you don’t have an account with them.
选择一项：
A. True
B. False 
正确答案是：False


The surcharges are used by bankers to pay for their BMWs.
选择一项：
A. True
B. False 
正确答案是：False

Humans are more likely to make mistakes if they work with money.
选择一项：
A. True 
B. False

The author prefers to use a free ATM even if it’s not so convenient.

B. False

Passage 2
    The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it.
     An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the American economic system.
    The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual.
 
11. Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE about the American economic system?
选择一项：
A. It’s a private-enterprise economy. 
B. It’s a market-oriented economy.
C. Consumers play a big role in determining goods and services that they want.
D. It ensures that the private business can always make profits. 
正确答案是：It ensures that the private business can always make profits.

12. The factors determining how goods and services are ____________.
选择一项：
A. the profit motive
B. the demand of consumers
C. the desire of individuals to make the best use of their money

13. A private-enterprise economy is mainly characterized by ________.
选择一项：
A. ownership of private property and certain rights 
B. ownership of manpower and natural resources
C. making free contracts with other private individuals
D. determining the price of a product
正确答案是：ownership of private property and certain rights

14. What’s the function of price in the American economic system?
选择一项：
A. It determines supply.
B. It determines demand.
C. It regulates supply and demand. 
D. None of the above.
正确答案是：It regulates supply and demand.

15. The passage is mainly about how American ______________.

Passage 1
 
When John and Victoria Falls arrived in New York City for one-year stay，they did not bring very many things with them. They had planned either to live in a furnished apartment or to buy used furniture. But they soon learned about a new system that more and more people are using. The renting of home furnishings (bed，tables，dishes，and so on) has become one of America's fastest growing businesses.
 
What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials，foreign students，airline workers，young married couples - people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture they really like. Meanwhile，they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.
 
One family，who now have a large，beautiful home of their own，liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don't like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new，and they are not sure what their neighbors might think. Remember these rules and regulations when you ride your bicycle，and help to keep China's roads safe.

Passage 1
My husband got married in 1981 and for the first ten years of our marriage I was happy to stay home and raise our three children. The four years ago, my youngest child went to school and I thought I might go back to work.
My husband was very supportive and helped me to make my decision. He emphasized all of the things I could do around the house, and said he thought I could be a great success in business.
After several weeks of looking for a job, I found my present job, which was working for a small public relations firm. At first, my husband was very proud of me and would tell his friends, "My clever little wife can run that company she's working for.”
But as his joking statement approached truth, my husband stopped talking to me about my job. I have received several promotions and pay increases, and I'm now making more money than he is. I can buy my new clothes and a new car. Because of our joint incomes, my husband and I can do many things we had always dreamed of doing, but we don't do these things because he is very unhappy.
We fight about little things and my husband is very critical of me in front of our friends. For the first time in our marriage, I think it is possible that our marriage may come to an end.
I love my husband very much, and I don't want him to feel inferior, but I also love my job. I think I can be a good wife and a working woman, but I don't know how. Who can give me some advice? Will I have to choose one or the other or can I keep both my husband and my new career?

Passage 2
A group of frogs wre traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into  a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed of （倾听）what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.
The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs shouted at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frog said, "Didn't you hear us?” The frog explained to them that he was a little deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.
The story teaches us two lessons:
1. There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift him up and help him make it through the day.
2. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill him.
Be careful of what you say. The power of words is sometimes hard to understand because an encouraging word can go such a long way. Anyone can speak words that tend to rob another of the spirit to continue in difficult times. Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another.
1. The underlined expression "as good as”(in Line 2, Para. 1) means      
A. hardly
B. equally good
C. no better than
D. almost, practically 
正确答案是：D

2. When other frogs told the two frogs there was no hope for the first time, the two frogs   A. were so afraid of the danger
   B. make up their mind to stay in the pit quietly
C. paid no attention to what they said and tried their best to get out
D. gave up their efforts immediately
正确答案是：C

2. One of the frogs fell down and died because         
A. he noticed what the other frogs were saying and stopped struggling
B. he was so tired
C. he didn't trust himself
D. he saw the other frogs unwilling to help him
正确答案是：A

3. The other frog managed to jump out of the pit because       
A. he was very strong physically
B. his ears were not good and he mistook their words for encouragement
C. he didn't believe what the other frogs had said
D. the pit was not deep enough 
正确答案是：B

4. Which of the following is TRUE?
A. An encouraging word may discourage others when they are in difficult times.
B. People should avoid saying destructive words to those who are in trouble.
C. The power of words lies in the beauty of language.
D. Words are just words and we don't have to be careful with words.

Passage 1
 
    Withdrawing money from the bank used to be so convenient. You could visit a money machine almost anywhere. Without paying a cent, you could get enough cash to buy a television or put a large down payment on some basketball shoes.
    But a couple of years ago some banks started charging a fee. If you didn’t have an account with them, you had to pay at least a dollar to withdraw money at their ATM (Automatic Teller Machine).
    Other banks followed suit and now the majority charge a fee. Some even charge as much as $3! For many people who withdraw money from ATMs daily, that’s more than many would actually save in a year.
    That’s a steep fee, especially when you’re trying to withdraw $5.
    To their credit, banks have tried to make ATMs much safer for us. They’ve installed bright lights and security cameras. They don’t want anyone else robbing us.
    Some lawmakers, bless their hearts, are trying to put a limit on the surcharges. They don’t want bankers to get carried away and use ATMs to pay for their BMWs. They don’t want the ATMs to display this message: “Please withdraw only half as much as you can afford, because we’re taking the other half.”
    Banks say they have to charge a fee because ATMs are expensive. They cost as much as $80,000 and that doesn’t even include the money inside.
    It would be cheaper to put a human in a box. But there’s probably a law against that. And humans, unlike machines, are prone to making mistakes. They’re also prone to running off to Mexico with the money.
    The surcharge also allows banks to install ATMs in many convenient places, such as parks, plazas and prisons. But in their haste to make ATMs more convenient, banks have made them less convenient for people like me. I’d rather have one free ATM in my neighborhood, than a dozen that want to swindle me. A couple of dollars may not seem like much to a banker, but to me, it means a feast at Taco Bell.
 
 
 
6. Using ATMs to withdraw money from the bank used to be free and convenient.
选择一项：
A. True 
B. False
正确答案是：True

Now all the banks will charge you $3 when you use their ATMs if you don’t have an account with them.
选择一项：

The surcharges are used by bankers to pay for their BMWs.

Passage 2
    The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it.
     An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the American economic system.
    The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual.
 
11. Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE about the American economic system?
选择一项：
A.  It’s a private-enterprise economy. 
B. It’s a market-oriented economy.
C. Consumers play a big role in determining goods and services that they want.
D. It ensures that the private business can always make profits. 
正确答案是：It ensures that the private business can always make profits.

12. The factors determining how goods and services are ____________.
选择一项：
A. the profit motive
B. the demand of consumers
C. the desire of individuals to make the best use of their money
D. all of the above 
正确答案是：all of the above

13. A private-enterprise economy is mainly characterized by ________.
选择一项：
A. ownership of private property and certain rights 
B. ownership of manpower and natural resources
C. making free contracts with other private individuals
D. determining the price of a product
正确答案是：ownership of private property and certain rights

选择一项：
A. It determines supply.
B. It determines demand.
C. It regulates supply and demand. 
D. None of the above.
正确答案是：It regulates supply and demand.

15. The passage is mainly about how American ______________.

Passage 1
 
When John and Victoria Falls arrived in New York City for one-year stay，they did not bring very many things with them. They had planned either to live in a furnished apartment or to buy used furniture. But they soon learned about a new system that more and more people are using. The renting of home furnishings (bed，tables，dishes，and so on) has become one of America's fastest growing businesses.
 
What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials，foreign students，airline workers，young married couples - people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture they really like. Meanwhile，they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.
 
One family，who now have a large，beautiful home of their own，liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don't like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new，and they are not sure what their neighbors might think. Remember these rules and regulations when you ride your bicycle，and help to keep China's roads safe.

Passage 1

My husband got married in 1981 and for the first ten years of our marriage I was happy to stay home and raise our three children. The four years ago, my youngest child went to school and I thought I might go back to work.

My husband was very supportive and helped me to make my decision. He emphasized all of the things I could do around the house, and said he thought I could be a great success in business.

After several weeks of looking for a job, I found my present job, which was working for a small public relations firm. At first, my husband was very proud of me and would tell his friends, "My clever little wife can run that company she's working for.”

But as his joking statement approached truth, my husband stopped talking to me about my job. I have received several promotions and pay increases, and I'm now making more money than he is. I can buy my new clothes and a new car. Because of our joint incomes, my husband and I can do many things we had always dreamed of doing, but we don't do these things because he is very unhappy.

We fight about little things and my husband is very critical of me in front of our friends. For the first time in our marriage, I think it is possible that our marriage may come to an end.

I love my husband very much, and I don't want him to feel inferior, but I also love my job. I think I can be a good wife and a working woman, but I don't know how. Who can give me some advice? Will I have to choose one or the other or can I keep both my husband and my new career?

1. The passage was probably written around 1996.
答案：A

2. The husband was supportive for the author at the beginning, for he encouraged her to look for a job.
答案：A

3. Her husband continued to support his wife when her career was approaching success.
答案：B

4. As she was making more money, the author found a gap taking place between her husband and her.
答案：A

Passage 2

A group of frogs wre traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into  a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed of （倾听）what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.

The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs shouted at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frog said, "Didn't you hear us?” The frog explained to them that he was a little deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.

The story teaches us two lessons:

1. There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift him up and help him make it through the day.

2. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill him.

Be careful of what you say. The power of words is sometimes hard to understand because an encouraging word can go such a long way. Anyone can speak words that tend to rob another of the spirit to continue in difficult times. Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another.

1. The underlined expression "as good as”(in Line 2, Para. 1) means   D    .
A. Hardly
B. equally good
C. no better than
D. almost, practically 

2. When other frogs told the two frogs there was no hope for the first time, the two frogs  C   .
A. were so afraid of the danger
B. make up their mind to stay in the pit quietly
C. paid no attention to what they said and tried their best to get out
D. gave up their efforts immediately

3. One of the frogs fell down and died because  A  
A. he noticed what the other frogs were saying and stopped struggling
B. he was so tired
C. he didn't trust himself
D. he saw the other frogs unwilling to help him




4. The other frog managed to jump out of the pit because  B  .
A. he was very strong physically
B. his ears were not good and he mistook their words for encouragement
C. he didn't believe what the other frogs had said
D. the pit was not deep enough

5. Which of the following is TRUE?  答案：B
A. An encouraging word may discourage others when they are in difficult times.
B. People should avoid saying destructive words to those who are in trouble.
C. The power of words lies in the beauty of language.
D. Words are just words and we don't have to be careful with words.

    Withdrawing money from the bank used to be so convenient. You could visit a money machine almost anywhere. Without paying a cent, you could get enough cash to buy a television or put a large down payment on some basketball shoes.
    But a couple of years ago some banks started charging a fee. If you didn’t have an account with them, you had to pay at least a dollar to withdraw money at their ATM (Automatic Teller Machine).
    Other banks followed suit and now the majority charge a fee. Some even charge as much as $3! For many people who withdraw money from ATMs daily, that’s more than many would actually save in a year.
    That’s a steep fee, especially when you’re trying to withdraw $5.
    To their credit, banks have tried to make ATMs much safer for us. They’ve installed bright lights and security cameras. They don’t want anyone else robbing us.
    Some lawmakers, bless their hearts, are trying to put a limit on the surcharges. They don’t want bankers to get carried away and use ATMs to pay for their BMWs. They don’t want the ATMs to display this message: “Please withdraw only half as much as you can afford, because we’re taking the other half.”
    Banks say they have to charge a fee because ATMs are expensive. They cost as much as $80,000 and that doesn’t even include the money inside.
    It would be cheaper to put a human in a box. But there’s probably a law against that. And humans, unlike machines, are prone to making mistakes. They’re also prone to running off to Mexico with the money.
The surcharge also allows banks to install ATMs in many convenient places, such as parks, plazas and prisons. But in their haste to make ATMs more convenient, banks have made them less convenient for people like me. I’d rather have one free ATM in my neighborhood, than a dozen that want to swindle me. A couple of dollars may not seem like much to a banker, but to me, it means a feast at Taco Bell.

6. Using ATMs to withdraw money from the bank used to be free and convenient.

A. True 
B. False

Passage 2
    The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it.

     An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the American economic system.
The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual.

11. Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE about the American economic system?
选择一项：
A.  It’s a private-enterprise economy. 
B. It’s a market-oriented economy.
C. Consumers play a big role in determining goods and services that they want.

选择一项：
A. the profit motive

13. A private-enterprise economy is mainly characterized by ________.
选择一项：
A. ownership of private property and certain rights 
B. ownership of manpower and natural resources
C. making free contracts with other private individuals
D. determining the price of a product
正确答案是：ownership of private property and certain rights

选择一项：
A. It determines supply.
B. It determines demand.
C. It regulates supply and demand. 
D. None of the above.
正确答案是：It regulates supply and demand.

Passage 1
When John and Victoria Falls arrived in New York City for one-year stay，they did not bring very many things with them. They had planned either to live in a furnished apartment or to buy used furniture. But they soon learned about a new system that more and more people are using. The renting of home furnishings (bed，tables，dishes，and so on) has become one of America's fastest growing businesses.
What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials，foreign students，airline workers，young married couples - people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture they really like. Meanwhile，they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.
One family，who now have a large，beautiful home of their own，liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don't like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new，and they are not sure what their neighbors might think. Remember these rules and regulations when you ride your bicycle，and help to keep China's roads safe.
